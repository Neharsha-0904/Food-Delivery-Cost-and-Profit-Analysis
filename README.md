# Food Delivery Cost & Profitability Analysis Project 📊🍔

Welcome to the Food Delivery Cost & Profitability Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze the financial aspects of a food delivery business to identify ways to improve profitability.

## Project Objective 🎯

The goal of our project is to examine the costs, revenues, and profitability of food delivery orders. By analyzing various components such as delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discounts, we aim to propose strategies to optimize profitability.

## How We Approach the Project 🛠️

### 1. Data Collection 📊

We work with a comprehensive dataset of food delivery orders, which includes:

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Restaurant ID**: Unique identifier for each restaurant.
- **Order Date and Time**: Timestamp of when the order was placed.
- **Delivery Date and Time**: Timestamp of when the order was delivered.
- **Order Value**: The monetary value of the order.
- **Delivery Fee**: The fee charged for delivery.
- **Payment Method**: The method used by the customer to pay for the order.
- **Discounts and Offers**: Discounts applied to the order.
- **Commission Fee**: The fee charged by the platform to the restaurant.
- **Payment Processing Fee**: The fee for processing the payment.
- **Refunds/Chargebacks**: Any refunds or chargebacks associated with the order.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation 🧹

- **Convert Date and Time Columns**: We convert the 'Order Date and Time' and 'Delivery Date and Time' columns to datetime format.
- **Extract Discount Information**: We extract numeric values from the 'Discounts and Offers' column to calculate the actual discount amount.

### 3. Cost and Revenue Calculations 💰

- **Total Costs**: We calculate the total costs per order by summing the delivery fee, payment processing fee, and discount amount.
- **Revenue**: We use the commission fee as the revenue from each order.
- **Profit**: We calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue.

### 4. Aggregated Metrics 📈

We aggregate data to get overall metrics such as:

- **Total Orders**: The total number of orders analyzed.
- **Total Revenue**: The sum of all revenues.
- **Total Costs**: The sum of all costs.
- **Total Profit**: The sum of all profits, which can highlight the overall profitability.

### 5. Simulation and Recommendations 🚀

We simulate profitability with recommended discount and commission rates to propose strategies for improving profitability:

- **Recommended Commission Percentage**: Set at 30%.
- **Recommended Discount Percentage**: Set at 6%.

We then recalculate the total costs and profit using these recommended percentages to estimate potential profitability improvements.

## Key Insights 🔍

Our analysis provides valuable insights into:

- **Profit Distribution**: Understanding how profits vary across orders.
- **Cost Proportions**: Identifying the major cost components in the delivery process.
- **Effectiveness of Discounts and Commissions**: Evaluating the impact of current discount and commission rates on profitability.

## Conclusion 🎉

The Food Delivery Cost & Profitability Analysis Project aims to optimize the financial performance of food delivery services. By analyzing and adjusting key components like discounts and commissions, we strive to enhance overall profitability.
